<p>You may have read <a href="http://ricardo.cc/2011/06/02/10-CoffeeScript-One-Liners-to-Impress-Your-Friends.html">10 CoffeeScript One Liners to Impress your Friends</a>, inspired by a post about <a href="http://mkaz.com/solog/scala/10-scala-one-liners-to-impress-your-friends.html">Scala one liners</a> on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2610243">HN</a>. Well I wanted to impress my friends with some one liners in <a href="http://gkz.github.com/LiveScript/">LiveScript</a>, and its recommended base library, <a href="http://gkz.github.com/prelude-ls/">prelude.ls</a>. You can try out all of these yourself on the <a href="http://gkz.github.com/LiveScript/">LiveScript website</a>.


<h3>1) Using jQuery</h3>

<p>Parentheses free chaining is nice.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ls">
$ \.content .find \.date-author .children \a .text!split ' ' .0
#=> 'George'
</pre>

<p><code>func!</code> is a bang call, equivalent to <code>func()</code>. You don't need to use a dot to access things in non-ambiguous situations. You can make string literals of strings without spaces using a leading backlash. You can also use <code>.0</code> instead of <code>[0]</code>.


<h3>2) Multiply each item in a list by 2</h3>

<p>Partially applied operators are also nice.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ls">
map (* 2), [1 to 5]
#=> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
</pre>

<p>You can use operators as functions in LiveScript by surrounding them in parentheses. You can also partially apply them, as shown above.


<h3>3) Joining objects with list comprehensions</h3>

<p>It's almost SQL!

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ls">
# some data
table1 =
  * id: 1
    name: \george
  * id: 2
    name: \mike
  * id: 3
    name: \donald
table2 =
  * id: 2
    age: 21
  * id: 1
    age: 20
  * id: 3
    age: 26

result = [{id, name, age} for {id, name} in table1 for {id:id2, age} in table2 when id is id2]
#=> [{id: 1, name: "george", age:20}, {id: 2, name: "mike", age: 21},{id:3, name: "donald", age: 26}]
</pre>

<p>You can list with asterisks. This is useful when listing implicit objects for instance. Also on display here is object destructuring.

<h3>4) Piping</h3>

<p>Using pipes is a nice way to make your code more readable if you have several nested function calls.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ls">
[1 2 3] |> map (* 2) |> filter (> 3) |> fold1 (+) 
#=> 10
</pre>

<p>In LiveScript if the preceding item is not callable you can omit the comma when listing things, as we've done with the input list.


<h3>5) Sum a list of numbers</h3>

<p>First, with the built in:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ls">
sum [1 to 5]
#=> 15
</pre>

<p>Well that was easy. What if we didn't have <code>sum</code>?

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ls">
fold1 (+), [1 to 5]
#=> 15
</pre>


<h3>6) Verify if a word exists in a string</h3>

<p><code>&lt;[ ... ]&gt;</code> delineates a list of one word strings. 

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ls">
wordList = &lt;[ LiveScript JavaScript prelude.ls ]&gt;
tweet    = 'This is an example tweet talking about LiveScript and stuff.'

any (in words tweet), wordList
#=> true
</pre>

<p>Here we used the operator <code>in</code>, with a partially applied second argument, as a function.


<h3>7) Happy Birthday</h3>

<p>If you multiply something by a string literal, it acts as a join. Eg. <code>list * ','</code> acts as <code>list.join ','</code>. Also in this example are list comprehensions and string interpolation. 

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ls">
["Happy Birthday #{if x is 2 then 'dear George' else 'to you'}" for x to 3] * ', '
#=> 'Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday dear George, Happy Birthday to you'
</pre>


<h3>8) Filter a list of numbers</h3>

<p><code>partition</code> is like a combination of <code>filter</code> and <code>reject</code>.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ls">
scores = [49 58 76 43 88 77 90]

[passed, failed] = partition (&gt; 60), scores
passed #=> [76, 88, 77, 90]
failed #=> [49, 58, 43]
</pre>

<p>Destructuring of returned values here.


<h3>9) Find the minimum in a list</h3>

<p>There's a built in:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ls">
minimum [14 35 -7 46 98]
#=> -7
</pre>

<p>What if we didn't have <code>minimum</code>? We can fold with the minimum operator.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ls">
fold1 (&lt;?), [14 35 -7 46 98]
#=> -7
</pre>


<h3>10) Sieve of Eratosthenes</h3>

<p>Determines if a number is prime. <code>|</code> is an alias for <code>when</code>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ls">
f = -&gt; [p.push x for x from 2 to it | not any (-&gt; x % it is 0), (p ?= [])] and it in p
f 12 #=> false
f 13 #=> true
</pre>
