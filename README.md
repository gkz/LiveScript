# LiveScript
is a language which compiles down to JavaScript. It is a fork of [Coco](http://satyr.github.com/coco/), which is in turn derived from [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). Like those two it has a relatively straightforward mapping to JavaScript. LiveScript is Coco but much more compatible with CoffeeScript, more functional, and more feature rich. LiveScript aims for increased expressiveness and code beauty.
